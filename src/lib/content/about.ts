        'Triptease makes SaaS products to help hoteliers increase their direct bookings. We work in autonomous cross-functional "squads" with full responsibility for full-stack development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.',
        'From summer 2020 to summer 2021, we built a feed of hotel prices to Google Hotel Ads and scaled it from scratch to over 1,000 hotels, serving a million prices a day. The prices come from on-site user tracking, screen-scraping and algorithmic inference.',
        'We are currently working on customisable on-site messages (e.g. showing a discount code to searchers who may have seen a cheaper price elsewhere). The work involves the UI of the messages themselves, the database where they are stored and data engineering to analyse and report on their performance.'

I also worked on the controls' C++ display driver to improve its refresh rate and responsiveness.",
