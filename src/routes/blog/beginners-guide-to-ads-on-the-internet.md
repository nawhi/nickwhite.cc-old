I love the internet - I work in tech, after all, so I make my living from and on it. But maybe you share a nagging feeling I have, that my phone and computer are using me as much as I am using them.

If so, here are some simple steps you can do regardless of technical experience to bring your internet life back to a healthier place.

## Step 1: Install an ad blocker

This is the single best way to improve your internet experience. If you do nothing else, do this!

**_Your task:_ Install and start using [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), on desktop and mobile.** Brave is almost identical to Chrome, but has built-in industrial-strength ad, tracking, and cookie blockers through its Shields feature.

If you can't switch your desktop browser at the moment, install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin), an ad-blocking extension with similar functionality.

Do this right now before reading number 2.

When you run an ad blocker, you'll notice that everything loads and runs much faster, because ad scripts place load on your browser. You may also feel less tired after a session on the internet, because it has become easier to focus without being semi-distracted by noisy background ads.

## Step 2: Opt out of personalised advertising

All ad companies are legally required to have an anonymous mode in which they collect no data about you. They are often buried in the settings, but they're always there and able to be turned on.

**_Your task:_ Do both of the following -**

1. **Turn off ad personalisation in Google Ad Settings** here: [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/). If you have a Google account, sign in and turn it off in there too.
2. **Turn off ad personalisation in AdChoices**, a collective of Google and hundreds of other ad networks, here: https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices
3. **Repeat** on all the devices that you most commonly use to access the internet.

When you went into Google Ad Settings, you probably saw the section where Google displays everything it knows about you. If they were scarily accurate, then that's quite bad - but if they were _inaccurate_, that's almost worse, as this is data about you that's being sold all over the internet! So this is a worthwhile 5-minute job.

Want to go further? Consider switching to a privacy-focused search engine like [Startpage](https://startpage.com), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com). None of these collect nearly as much intrusive data about you as Bing or Google, at the cost of search results that are occasionally less useful.

## Step 3: Learn to spot ads

Traditional media like a newspaper, TV and radio generally make it very clear what's an ad and what isn't. Tech companies, on the other hand, have exploited the internet's comparative lack of regulation to become very, _very_ good at disguising sponsorship.

**_Your task:_ When browsing the internet, ask yourself: what on this page is an advertisement?**

Ad blockers don’t block everything. You will still see:

- _sponsored search results_ designed to look like bona-fide search results, but which were actually paid for instead of being organically relevant to your query
- _sponsored content_ also known as "natural ads", these are bits of the webpage styled to look like the regular page/blog/recipe/article but which were actually paid for
- _affiliate links_ links to products from otherwise impartial blogs and news articles that will earn the host a small commission if you buy the product

Try it out: see if you can spot the ads in the examples in the [appendix](#ads).

(If you have kids, teach them too: social media is especially rife with disguised affiliate programs aimed at teenagers and young adults. For more info, read the UK Advertising Standards Authority's [Influencer monitoring report](https://www.asa.org.uk/resource/influencer-monitoring-report-march-2021.html).)

## Step 5: Understand what a good search looks like

By now, you'll be good at spotting what is an ad, and what is not, when using search engines.

Unfortunately, even if you only use these non-ad search results (known as "organic" search results), the way that these results are served to you are still highly influenced by factors that probably don’t align with your objectives.

For instance, Google Maps results are ranked in part by how often the business owner updates their opening times. Useful, sure - but when I'm looking for breakfast, I care enough about it being tasty that I'd rather take a risk on a cafe not being open.

**_Your task:_ Use search engines for facts, not for opinions.**

This is best demonstrated by example.

Searches that the internet is absolutely ideal for:

_"Pharmacy near Woking station open now"_<br/>
_"Bicycle hire in London"_<br/>
_"What country are peacocks native to"_<br/>
_"Diameter of Jupiter"_

These are good searches because they represent facts that are easy to verify, and therefore likely to be correct. They also presumably represent things that would have small consequences if the answer was incorrect. (If you are asked for the diameter of Jupiter at gunpoint, look it up in a book!)

Searches that the internet is pretty good for, with some caveats:

_"Best way to clean sick off a carpet"_<br/>
_"Restaurant nearby open now"_

These will probably get you to a solution, but you may have to trawl through a lot of crap (e.g. "You can't possibly clean sick off a carpet... call Carpet Cleaning 101 for a free quote!"), and you may not end up with the best solution (e.g. a restaurant that spends more time updating their opening hours than cooking nice food).

Searches that the internet is terrible for:

_"Mental health support"._
Google's highest result for this term is a company offering paid therapy. If you are desperate, you will forget to filter out ads, and end up getting sold something when you could have got help for free. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

_"The best Chinese restaurant in Bedford"._ Reviews are SO gameable - that's an article for another time. Plus, ironically, when everyone searches for "the best X", they all pile in to just a few restaurants - which stresses the restaurants' capacity and usually makes the experience worse. You'll know this if you've ever been to a "viral brunch spot", queued for hours, then actually had a pretty average meal.

_“How to lose weight / gain muscle / learn Spanish / etc fast”._ You can’t do any of these things fast, and you probably know that. By definition, then, the results will mostly be snake oil.

_“Should I take Ritalin”,_ or other medical advice. Ask a GP instead, or filter your search to the NHS website by adding `site:nhs.uk`. As a general rule, if you are accessing specialist information for free, know that someone somewhere is paying for that service: if it's not you or the government, it will probably be an advertiser of some sort. They will want their pound of flesh in one way or another.

A bad search meets any of the following criteria: (1) there could be a substantial risk of harm if the results are incorrect or misleading; (2) you are not in a frame of mind where you can critically interpret the results; (3) you would spend less time figuring the result out if you just used your own intuition and problem-solving skills.

Google Maps makes it insanely difficult to spot sponsored results. Here, the Tesco Express pin is actually an ad - it's a slightly more prominent square icon, instead of the round pin. The clue is the small Tesco ad at the top-left, which _is_ marked "Ad". ([source](https://www.google.com/maps/search/food+shop/@51.4140281,-0.0679134,15z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e6!5m1!1e4))#
