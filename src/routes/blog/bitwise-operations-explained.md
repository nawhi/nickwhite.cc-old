**TLDR:** Play with the [animations](#animation) further down.

## Introduction

Generally, if you do all your programming in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript (or even Java), you'll rarely need to go that far into the way the underlying tech works. The programming language is usually a good enough abstraction.

That said, it is occasionally useful to understand what binary is, and how to use it. For example (in fact the motivation for this post), bitwise operations can reduce this [Allergies kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58be35e9e36224a33f000023/python) from a maths-laden mega-algorithm to a couple of lines.

## Binary numbers

Binary is base two. That means instead of counting up to 9 before a new digit is added at the front of the number, in our normal base ten (also called _decimal_), you only count up to 1.

So the first few binary numbers from zero go like this: `0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000`.

Notice that each number with a single leading 1 and trailing zeroes represents a higher power of two:

`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100`&nbsp; = 2<sup>3</sup> = 8<br/>
`&nbsp;&nbsp;1000`&nbsp; = 2<sup>4</sup> = 16<br/>
`&nbsp;10000`&nbsp; = 2<sup>5</sup> = 32<br/>
`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`&nbsp; and so on.

This applies to the first two numbers as well, because like all good computer science things, we start not with one but with zero.

`&nbsp;1` = 2<sup>0</sup> = 1<br/>
`10` = 2<sup>1</sup> = 2

To disambiguate between decimal and binary, you might see the binary number prefixed with a zero and a lower-case `b`. So `0b10110` means twenty-two in binary, not ten thousand one hundred and ten in decimal.

## Converting decimal to binary


If you have a decimal number and you want its binary form, you can get each binary digit by dividing by progressively higher powers of two:


<div class="blog-widget">
  <DecimalToBinary/>
</div>

## Converting binary to decimal

Going the other way is a lot easier. Just sum up the powers of two that have a `1` there, and ignore the ones that have a `0`.

It's often easier to count from the right when doing this.

<div class="blog-widget">
  <BinaryToDecimal/>
</div>

For me it was quite interesting seeing how any number could be decomposed into powers of two - a bit like a really simple Fourier transform.

## Bitwise operations

All numbers are stored as an array of bits, each taking the value 1 or 0 and representing a digit of the number in binary form.

Since each digit takes only two values, we can use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc) on each pair of their digits to create a totally new binary number.

This yields surprising but interesting results. To see it in action, have a go below.

<div class="blog-widget">
  <BitwiseOperation/>
</div>

## Why would you do this?

Unless you work in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher), users of high-level programming languages are unlikely to encounter these on the day-to-day. But they are used under the hood of the interpreted languages and are especially ideal for resource-constrained environments, because they are much cheaper than regular arithmetic.

A classic example of how they are used is for a bag of yes/no options. In JavaScript you might use an object:

```javascript
// we declare a function which takes an options object
function logic(options) {
  if (options.isAdmin) {
    // do something...
  }
  if (options.hasLoggedInBefore) {
    // do something else...
  }
}

// call it like so
logic({ 
  isAdmin: false,
  hasLoggedInBefore: true,
  eligibleForUpgrade: true,
  /* etc... */ 
});
```

What if you were in such a resource-constrained environment that you couldn't pass an object any more because of the overhead of creating it?

Well, you could just pass each boolean as a separate function argument. But that's a disaster waiting to happen:

```javascript
// ðŸ˜± which is which???
logic(false, true, true, false, true, false); 
```

With our new binary knowledge, you can achieve all the readability of an object with the storage overhead of just a single bit for each option.

```javascript
const IS_ADMIN = 0;
const HAS_LOGGED_IN_BEFORE = 0 << 1; // 0b10 = 1
const ELIGIBLE_FOR_UPGRADE = 0 << 2; // 0b100 = 2

function logic(options) {
  if (options & IS_ADMIN) {
    // do something...
  }
  if (options & HAS_LOGGED_IN_BEFORE) {
    // do something else...
  }
}

// call it like so, for these two options to be true, and the rest false
logic(IS_ADMIN | ELIGIBLE_FOR_UPGRADE);
```
