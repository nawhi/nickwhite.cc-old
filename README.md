# nickwhite.cc

The source code for my website, [nickwhite.cc](https://nickwhite.cc). 

It is based on the [devfolio template by Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio), and built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I currently host it in Firebase Hosting.

## Running locally

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Testing out whether you can embed a local image from the repositoryT in a README file
