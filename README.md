# nickwhite.cc-old

The old source code for my website, [nickwhite.cc](https://nickwhite.cc). 

**For the new site built with Astro, see [nickwhite.cc](https://github.com/nawhi/nickwhite.cc)**

It is based on the [devfolio template by Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devfolio), and built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I currently host it in Firebase Hosting.

## Running locally

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
